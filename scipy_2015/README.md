Title: Agent-Based Modeling in Python with Mesa
Speakers: Jackie Kazil & David Masad

Description:
Agent-based modeling is currently a hole in Python’s robust and growing scientific computing ecosystem. Mesa is a new open-source package meant to fill that gap. It allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using an innovative browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python’s extensive data analysis tools. Mesa is being developed by a group of modeling practitioners with experience in academia, government, and the private sector. It is also completely open-source, encouraging users to contribute to what we hope will be a growing repository of model components which others can reuse and expand upon in future research.
